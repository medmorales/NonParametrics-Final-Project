TOPIC I
Subtopic 1: Permutation test for variance

In this analysis, we have a dataset that contains two samples. In order to compare two samples, we take a look at their measures of centrality. 
In this case we want to compare the samples using their variances. We want to know if the two variances from the two samples are statistically 
different.

Topic II

Part 1.
For this analysis, we are using a dataset  called “crowdedness.csv”. This dataset contains 4 columns and covers different aspects of living 
conditions from several countries. Column 1 in this dataset is the list of countries that have been reported on by name. Column 2 is titled 
“Crowdedness” and is the average number of persons per room living in a home. Column 3 is labeled “fertility” and is the number of live births 
born per woman of a certain age per year. Lastly, column 4 is the GDP, a measure of national wealth, of the country.
